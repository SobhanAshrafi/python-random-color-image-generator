# python-random-color-image-generator
### generating images contain random colors project with python



#### this python code can creat two kind of image:

        1- can creat images contain lines with random colors

        2- can creat images with random color pixels (more interesting)


well to do first one you should only run the main code.

but to do second one you need to uncomment line 25 in the main code and then run it:

        24 -            # uncomment below line to make all pixels color random
        25 -            # Color = random_color_generator()




#### the result folder contains the generated images from every two approach. you can see them below.
